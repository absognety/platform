# Consent Management
When the data gets imported and the privacy center is set up, we have knowledge of what actually needs to be done and what all capabilities our platform will have onto that data, taking into consideration the different permissions given to certain actions over data. This section is just an assurance to all the users connected to our platform either directly or indirectly that their data is safe and secure and no action will be taken over their data unless and until their consent is taken. While setting up the privacy center for a tenant, our platform provides a functionality where the user has been given the ability to choose what all actions can be performed on his/her data. In this way, we not only promise **security** of their data but also a **bridge of trust** between the user and the platform.
