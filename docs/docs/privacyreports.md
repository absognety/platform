# Reports

- There are reports that can be generated based on its type. There are 3 types of reports available for usage:
    - DSR (Data Subject Request)
    - Consent
    - Privacy Center

- Now these reports can be scaled up to any amount unless we restrict them under a timeline. Hence, 2 drop-down options specifying month and year are available. Using these filters, the report can be generated with a certain specificity.

## Steps to generate a report
1. Navigate to Reports. 
2. Select the report type as per your need. 
3. Select the year and the month for which the report needs to be generated. 
4. Click on Generate Report. You will be able to see the report on the screen. If there are any activities performed in that time frame, you can generate a PDF for the same by clicking on the button present at the right corner.

### Note
- If there are no activities under the selected time frame, the generate PDF button will be disabled as there is nothing to review.
