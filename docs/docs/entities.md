## Entities

Click on Entities to see individual dataflow entities data and its attributes. 

An entity is a collection of attributes and metadata that defines a concept (such as Account or Contact) and can be defined by any data producer. An entity may match the schema of a standard entity, defined as part of the Common Data Model and listed in the [GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/cdmrepo). Entities that donâ€™t match one of the standard shapes are said to be custom entities.

After complete success over the connection establishment and the data ingestion, you will be able to see the different entities that were ingested from the dataflow. They are distinctively shown in a tabular format with some important attributes as names, total records, Source, last refresh date and entity type (by default is CUSTOM).
