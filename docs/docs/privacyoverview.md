# Overview
This section manages the privacy associations with the tenant. It has subsections that demonstrates the different features appended to the Privacy section in order to work in a more efficient and secure way. This basically allows us to create a secure and understandable environment for any type to data to be handled and processed. One of the most important key feature to any successful idea/worflow is how secure it is, whether or not an end user has to worry about anything regarding his/her data.
Below are some of the subsections that help us in carrying out a secure way of handling data.

1. Data Maps: The mapping of the entities based on requirement and creating a more understandable data for processing. It also handles the retaining the data that has been processed. An important feature inside Data Maps is PII Map. It helps in handling the profiling of every user inside the data. As the name suggests, Personality Identifiable Information has everything to clearly distinguish between different users based on some entity present in their data.

2. Setting up Privacy Center: The platform provides the user an ability to determine the policies that any tenant possesses. The user has the right to know and decide what all actions can be taken over his/her data.

3. Handling Data Service Requests: In this section, one can handle the DSRs giving the user access to decide what he/she wantes with her data.

4. Genreating Reports: After all the informative buildups, the user would like to know what all activites has been performed on a particular set of data. For that, our platform provides a report generating section where the user has the choice to select the type of activity he/she wants to monitor and the time frame within which the monitoring needs to be reported. The user can generate a PDF form of report for better understanding.
