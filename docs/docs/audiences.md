# Insights

**Audiences**: In this section, we can create and oversee the audiences table which is a tabular representation denoting the number of members in every audience created with their current status. An audience is a group of profiles characterized by a defined set of attributes based filters. The other table below it elaborates the work history that corresponds to all the successful and failed iterations over creating audiences.
