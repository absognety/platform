    - **Download**:  Enabling this feature will let the platform/client download and use the data for anything and everything.
    - **Erase**: Enabling this feature states that if a user removes his/her account from a particular server, all the data associated with that user will be erased.
    - **Consent**: Enabling this feature will let the user consent of all the actions and informed with all the activities performed on his/her data through reports which can be gererated from the [Report](https://skypointcdpdocs.z22.web.core.windows.net/docs/privacyreports.html) Section.
    - **Do not Sell**: Enabling this feature will prohibit the platform from using any user's data out of this domain and hence cannot be sold or shared with other identities.
