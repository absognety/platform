# Templates

- Verification regarding different entities of the data present in respective fields. Every important entity (column value) present in any dataflow has a technicality binned with it that distinguishes it from other entities. Templates provide a similar feature here. They contain some pre-build rules for some entities with their subject as the rule with which they can be distinguished. These rules consist of names from different entities so that they can be marked when their usage is required. For customer reliability, there is an option to even update the template where the customer can simply click on the button present under the Action column and update the parameters in the template or even produce a new one.
