# Data Use Case
Data use case basically describes an application of data and analytics to improve business performance. It covers the phase where the application of analytics to a business challenge provides sufficient benefits to justify the investment required to acquire, analyze, prepare and act on the **data**.
The fundamental purpose of SkyPoint's CDP is to build customer trust and analyze customer's data as permitted by one, to enlighten and feature them with their needs by understanding what they actually demand. SkyPoint helps in mapping different types of data to visualize the key features, predict and present the user/customer with a solution which would satisfy the goal to be achieved. All of this is performed in various phases on the platform resulting in a complete knowledge about the data and the solution.

## Hands-On Experience with the platform
After you have created an account on the platform, you will need to import the data and start the different functionalitites offered here. Features like data mapping, ML match and ML merge are really helpful in getting various insights regarding the different entities present inside data. Also, at the same time, it lets you decide what all permissions need to be given i.e actions like download, erase, delete, do not sell, etc. The platform lets you create a privacy center of you own to clerify all the necessary steps done to secure the data.

## Handling Audiences & Metrics
After the data has been imported and the mapping of the features has been successfully completed, we proceed to creating an ML flow in addition to an ML merge activity operation. This helps us create an insight for the data so as to conclude regarding some conclusive features. After that, we tend to create a profilic view of all the entities present in the data so as to understand in a very systematic manner about each entity and the metric gives a much more filtered and featured view over data.
