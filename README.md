# SkyPoint Customer Data Platform (CDP) and Data Privacy Infrastructure (DPI)

Customer data makes up the foundation of an organization. It tells whoâ€™s buying, what they want, what they consent and how best to reach them. But for many businesses, customer data is siloed across systems, impossible to unify, manage privacy and not actionable across the organization.

We built SkyPoint Customer Data Platform (CDP) and Data Privacy Infrastructure (DPI) from the ground up to solve this problem by unifying all your customer data at scale, delivering a complete customer 360, privacy compliance and predictive insights.
